I’m Leona, a Platform Engineer, software developer specializing in cloud-native infrastructure and developer experience. 
I build resilient reusable AWS environments with Terraform, optimize observability with Datadog, and automate deployments so developers can focus on code—not configs.  By day, I architect AWS & Terraform & security solutions; by night, I’m either carving up a mountain on my snowboard or popping wheelies on my sportbike. Always aiming for clean readable code, predictable systems, and the occasional adrenaline rush.

--- Core Competencies ---

Cloud & IaC
Architecting multi-account AWS with Terraform modules that behave themselves—no surprises, please.

Observability & Monitoring
Datadog dashboards fine-tuned so alerts only sound when something actually needs your attention.

CI/CD & Security
Pipelines tighter than a helmet strap, complete with Snyk scans to keep vulnerabilities off the guest list.

Containerization
Docker magic on Windows and Ubuntu VMs—because your services deserve a snug home.

Code Quality & Testing
Node.js, Java, Python, all unit-tested until they confess their deepest secrets.

Front-End Development
React + Supabase (or the occasional Firebase throwback)—a UI as smooth as fresh powder.
